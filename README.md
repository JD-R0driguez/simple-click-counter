# Click Counter Program

As if the world needs another web application that counts clicks! But here it is anyway - the amazing Click Counter Program!

## Usage
Are you ready for this? To use the click counter, all you have to do is click the Increase, Reset or Decrease buttons and voi-la you will have a counter.

## Code Structure
If you're curious, the web application consists of three files: index.html, style.css, and index.js. The index.html file contains the structure of the webpage, including the button and the output field. The style.css file contains the styles that are applied to the elements on the webpage, such as the colors, fonts, and layout. And finally, the index.js file contains the JavaScript code that implements the click counting logic. Oh, the excitement!

## Click Counting Logic
The JavaScript code uses an event listener to detect when the button is clicked. Each time the button is clicked, the click counter is incremented by one, and the new value is displayed in the output field.
